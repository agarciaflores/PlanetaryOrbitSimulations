# PlanetaryOrbitSimulations
Some fun atro stuff

These are some projects I've been working on in hopes of improving my python understanding. My goal is to implement things like lists and dictionaries instead of coding via repetitive variables.

My first project (EarthMarsSimulation.py) involves simulating a solar system containing only the sun, Earth, and Mars. Earth and Mars are interacting with the sun and vice versa, but not with one another. Forces only include Newton's law of universal gravitation; a completely classical system.
