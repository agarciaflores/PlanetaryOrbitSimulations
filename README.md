# PlanetaryOrbitSimulations
Some fun atro stuff

These are some projects I've been working on in hopes of improving my python understanding. My goal is to implement things like lists and dictionaries instead of coding via variables.

My first project (EarthMarsSimulation.py) involves simulating a solar system containing only the sun, Earth, and Mars. Earth and Mars are interacting with the sun and vice versa, but not with one another. Forces only include Newton's law of universal gravitation; a completely classical system. The initial conditions of the system have Earth and Mars start along the x-axis; each at their furthest position from the sun.

My second project (SolarSystemSimulation.py) includes all eight planets and Pluto, with the same conditions as my first project described above. The defined viewing window is set to include Pluto's orbit, but can be changed in order to see clearly the smaller orbits about the sun. This project emphasizes the use of dictionaries.
